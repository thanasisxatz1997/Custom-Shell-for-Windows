ALL THE FILES MUST BE AT THE FOLDER WHERE THE PROGRAM IS COMPILED(Where the .exe is)

1)dir:
Shows the contents of the current directory

2)echo:
The correct syntax is: echo alphanumeric_value
Prints the alphanumeric_value given by the user

3)find:
The correct syntax is: find source_text_file alphanumeric > destination_text_file

The program distinguishes lower and upper characters
if for example you search for the word Hello but there is only the word hello
then the program will not copy the line to the destination file

There must be no spaces in the source_text_file or the destination_text_file

4)del:
The correct syntax is: del *.* alphanumeric

The program distinguishes lower and upper characters.
If for example you type del *.* Hello but there is only the word hello in the file
the program will not delete the said file.

5)tree:
Shows the tree for the current directory

How to test the program!
For the find command:
inside the .exe file  include RandomText.txt
open up .exe and type the command find RandomText.txt Difficulty > destination.txt

or instead of Difficulty some other word that exists in the txt file.

For del command:
after you run the find command and destination.txt has been created run the del command del *.* Difficulty

or instead of Difficulty some other word that exists in the txt file.
